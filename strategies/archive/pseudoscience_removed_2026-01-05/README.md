# Archived: Pseudoscience-Based Code (2026-01-05)

## Why These Files Were Removed

Following **PMW (Prove Me Wrong)** validation protocol in `specs/028-validation/`, these files were archived because they rely on concepts with **ZERO academic evidence** in trading:

## Files Archived

### `universal_laws.py`
- **Claimed**: Fibonacci retracements, Golden Ratio, Gann angles
- **Evidence Found**: 0 peer-reviewed papers demonstrating statistical edge
- **Verdict**: Self-fulfilling prophecy at best, noise trading at worst

## PMW Validation Summary

From `specs/028-validation/research_vs_repos_analysis.md`:

```
P5: Leggi Naturali ❌ REFUTED

Searches performed:
- "Fibonacci trading statistical significance" → 0 results
- "Golden ratio stock returns academic" → 0 results
- "Wave theory trading empirical evidence" → 0 results

Counter-evidence found:
- Multiple papers showing Fibonacci levels = random chance
- No replication studies for Elliott Wave theory
```

## What Remains Valid

- **Fractals (Mandelbrot)**: Valid under P2 (Non Lineare) - power-law distributions
- **Power-law scaling (Giller)**: Validated with academic citations (Baker 2013, Meyer 2023)

## Restoration

If future academic evidence emerges supporting these methods, files can be restored from this archive. Until then, they remain here as historical artifacts.
