However, due to the difficulty of estimating its parameters, it cannot be applied to all periods. In some cases, naive strategies such as Equallyweighted and Value-weighted portfolios can even get better performance. Under these circumstances, we can use multiple classic strategies as multiple strategic arms in multi-armed bandit to naturally establish a connection with the portfolio selection problem. This can also help to maximize the rewards in the bandit algorithm by the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we present a portfolio bandit strategy through Thompson sampling which aims to make online portfolio choices by effectively exploiting the performances among multiple arms. Also, by constructing multiple strategic arms, we can obtain the optimal investment portfolio to adapt different investment periods. Moreover, we devise a novel reward function based on users’ different investment risk preferences, which can be adaptive to various investment styles. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed portfolio strategy has marked superiority across representative realworld market datasets in terms of extensive evaluation criteria. ",

Up to now, the mean-variance paradigm has remained the mainstream choice for academia and industry. However, the main problem of using a single strategy is that it cannot be adapted to the changing environment. For instance, in an event of the stock market crash, the sold-all strategy with cash will have a good performance. Meanwhile, during the bull market, the buy-and-hold strategy is likely to perform even better. In terms of this issue, a simple approach in the investment field is to periodically review the effectiveness of the current strategy and appropriately adjust the strategy for the next phase. This is a typical problem of exploration and exploitation. Therefore, we use reinforcement learning to solve the problem of how to determine optimal portfolio strategy to adapt for different investment periods. ",

In our experiments, the FF25, FF49, FF100 datasets include monthly returns of 25, 49, and 100 assets more than half a century. Among them, FF25 and FF100 are formed on size and book-to-market, while FF49 is an industry portfolio. The second one is a more frequent stock market data, which includes constituents of the SP500 and ETFs in the US stock market. We exclude assets with missing data for the past five years.

PBTS outperforms other methods on most datasets, only below the MV and SSR on the FF25 dataset and lower than VW and OBP on the ETFs dataset.

However, in the mid-term high frequency situation, through the ETF and SP500 datasets, we realize that PBTS is not robust enough and depends on the performance of basic strategies. ",

Moreover, we devise a reward function based on the user’s investment risk preference to judge the standard and select the optimal arm of each period via Thompson sampling. Our algorithm could appropriately balance the benefits and risks well and achieve higher returns by controlling risk. ",
