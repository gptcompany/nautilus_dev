## Overview

This adapter is implemented in Rust, with optional Python bindings for use in Python-based
workflows. The adapter uses REST for reference data and order management, with WebSocket for
real-time market data and execution updates.

## Components

The adapter includes multiple components which can be used together or separately depending on the
use case:

- `ArchitectHttpClient`: Low-level HTTP API connectivity.
- `ArchitectWebSocketClient`: Low-level WebSocket API connectivity.
- `ArchitectInstrumentProvider`: Instrument parsing and loading functionality.
- `ArchitectDataClient`: Market data feed manager.
- `ArchitectExecutionClient`: Account management and trade execution gateway.

:::note
Most users will define a configuration for a live trading node and won't need to work with these
lower-level components directly.

It's recommended you refer to the Architect documentation in conjunction with this NautilusTrader
integration guide.

## API credentials

API credentials are required for authentication. Provide these via environment variables.

### Required credentials

| Environment Variable    | Description                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `ARCHITECT_API_KEY`     | Your Architect API key (e.g., `ak_...`). |
| `ARCHITECT_API_SECRET`  | Your Architect API secret.               |

### Optional 2FA credentials

If your account has two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled:

| Environment Variable    | Description                                       |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `ARCHITECT_TOTP_SECRET` | Base32 TOTP secret for auto-generating 2FA codes. |

This is the base32 secret displayed when you set up 2FA (often shown as a QR code or text).

### Environment selection

| Environment Variable    | Description                                                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ARCHITECT_IS_SANDBOX`  | Set to `true` for sandbox environment (default), `false` for production. |

## Authentication

Architect uses bearer token authentication via HTTP headers:

1. API key and secret (with optional TOTP) obtain a session token via `/authenticate`.
2. The session token is used as a bearer token for subsequent REST and WebSocket requests.

Session tokens expire after a configurable period (default: 3600 seconds).

## Configuration

### AX Exchange API endpoints

| Environment | HTTP API                                         | Market Data WebSocket                            | Orders WebSocket                                     |
