<@391823539034128397> Lets see how a dev focused docs channel goes. I think users are generally good at searching the server, this channel can be focused on suggestions for concise solutions for problems/challenges that often come up and are currently poorly documented - the idea being they will be quickly lifted from here and into the docs
