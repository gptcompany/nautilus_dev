I think that in live it's the broker who is responsible for this, it depends on your live account

Hi everyone!
I’m looking for recommendations on Python libraries that work well with Databento data, specifically for data visualization / charting and backtesting trading strategies.

Ideally, I’d like something that can handle high-frequency or historical market data efficiently and integrate smoothly into a research workflow.

Any suggestions, libraries, or example projects would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
